<p>
<br>
<b>QUELL NAUSEA</b> - Try frozen ginger chips. First, infuse fresh ginger in hot water. Strain, then freeze the concoction in ice cube trays.
<br>
<br>
<b>SOOTHE A SORE THROAT</b> - Gargle twice daily with a solution of six pressed garlic cloves mixed into a glass of warm (not hot) water. Follow the regimen for 3 days. Research shows that fresh garlic juice has antimicrobial properties that fight pain-causing bacteria. The warm liquid soothes inflamed tissue.
<br>
<br>
<b>CURB A COUGH</b> - Indulge in a square or two of dark chocolate. Researchers found that chocolate's theobromine compound is more effective than codeine at suppressing persistent coughs without the side effects of drowsiness and constipation.
<br>
<br>
<b>REDUCE A FEVER</b> - Sip linden flower tea, which works in two ways: It stimulates the hypothalamus to better control your temperature, and it dilates blood vessels, inducing sweating. Steep 1 tablespoon of dried herb (available in health food stores) in a cup of hot water for 15 minutes, then sip. Drink three to four cups a day. If you still run hot after a day of sipping tea, seek medical attention. 
<br>
<br>
<b>BEAT INSOMNIA</b> - Before bedtime, eat a handful of cherries (or drink tart cherry juice), which scientists discovered are jam-packed with melatonin, the same hormone created by your body to regulate sleep patterns. 
Then steep yourself in a hot bath to relax your muscles and your mind. In bed, rest your head on a lavender-filled pillowâ€”the fragrance induces sleepiness.

<br>

<li> Get out you sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat </li>  
<li>Spring clean your garden</li>
 <li>Add more fruits and vegetables in your diet. Stock up on green tea.</li>
